# Reaction Time Game with Arduino

This project is a reaction time game built using an **Arduino Uno**. In this game, an LED lights up randomly, and the player must move the joystick in the correct direction as quickly as possible. The LCD screen displays the player's reaction time and updates the score after each round. The game helps to test and improve the player's reaction speed.

## Project Overview
The reaction time game is designed to:
- **Light up an LED**: The game randomly selects one of four LEDs to light up.
- **Measure joystick reaction**: The player must move the joystick in response to the LED light.
- **Display feedback**: The reaction time and score are displayed on a 1602 I2C LCD screen.

The game helps measure how quickly a player can react and provides feedback after each round.

## Features
- Randomly lights up one of four LEDs.
- Tracks and displays reaction time in milliseconds.
- Keeps track of the player's score.
- Easy to reset and replay.
